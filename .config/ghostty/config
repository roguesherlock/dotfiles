# All of the configurations behavior adjust various metrics determined by the
# font. The values can be integers (1, -1, etc.) or a percentage (20%, -15%,
# etc.). In each case, the values represent the amount to change the original
# value.
# 
# For example, a value of `1` increases the value by 1; it does not set it to
# literally 1. A value of `20%` increases the value by 20%. And so on.
# 
# There is little to no validation on these values so the wrong values (i.e.
# `-100%`) can cause the terminal to be unusable. Use with caution and reason.
# 
# Some values are clamped to minimum or maximum values. This can make it
# appear that certain values are ignored. For example, the underline position
# is clamped to the height of a cell. If you set the underline position so
# high that it extends beyond the bottom of the cell size, it will be clamped
# to the bottom of the cell.
# 
# `adjust-cell-height` has some additional behaviors to describe:
# 
#   * The font will be centered vertically in the cell.
# 
#   * The cursor will remain the same size as the font.
# 
#   * Powerline glyphs will be adjusted along with the cell height so
#     that things like status lines continue to look aligned.

# Window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells and the
# window border. The `x` option applies to the left and right padding and the
# `y` option is top and bottom. The value is in points, meaning that it will
# be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.

# of the final row may exist. If this is `true`, then this extra padding
# is automatically balanced between all four edges to minimize imbalance on
# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
# 
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still
# apply. The other padding is applied first and may affect how many grid cells
# actually exist, and this is applied last in order to balance the padding
# given a certain viewport size and grid cell size.

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal

# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).

#

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", and "tabs".
# 
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
# 
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
# 
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
# 
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

# The colorspace to use for the terminal window. The default is `srgb` but

# windows, tabs, and splits.
