# On macOS, if `macos-titlebar-tabs` is set, the window theme will be

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).

# If `true`, places the tab bar in the titlebar for tabbed windows.

# fullscreen (native fullscreen) with only one tab. This is not considered
# a bug but if you'd like to improve this behavior then I'm open to it and
# please contribute to the project.
# 
# This option intercepts the native tab bar view from macOS and forces it to use
# different positioning. Because of this, it might be buggy or break entirely if
# macOS changes the way its native tab bar view is constructed or managed.
# This has been tested on macOS 14.
# 
# For macOS 13 users: saved window state will not restore tabs correctly
# if this is enabled. macOS 14 does not have this issue.
